* Introduction

** RngStream

RngStreams is an object-oriented random-number package with many long streams and substreams,
based on the MRG32k3a RNG from reference [fn:1] below and proposed in [fn:2].

It has implementations in C, C++, Java, R, and some other languages.
The main description and documentation is in the c++ directory, in the paper streams.pdf.
Directories c and java gives a short description of the interfaces in C and Java, respectively.

The package is copyrighted by Pierre L'Ã‰cuyer and the University of Montreal.
It can be used freely for any purpose.

If you use it for your research, please cite the relevant publications in which MRG32k3a
and the package with multiple streams were proposed.

** C# implementation

This code is adapted from the Java implementation. The implementation:
 - Inherits from [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random?view=net-5.0][System.Random]]
 - Constructors:
  - =RngStream()= :: initially use the seed ={12345u,12345u,12345u,12345u,12345u,12345u}= and then subsequently advances to the next stream
  - =RngStream(string name)= :: to set the stream name
  - =RngStream(int seed)= :: with equivalent seed behaviour as R's =set.seed(seed)=.
 - Standard =RngStream= methods:
  - =void SetPackageSeed(uint[])= :: to set the package seed
  - =void ResetStartStream()= :: to reset to the start of the stream
  - =void ResetNextSubstream()= :: to reset to the start of the sub-stream
  - =void SetAntithetic(bool)= :: to determine whether to use antithetic sampling (default=false)
  - =void IncreasedPrecis(bool)= :: to determine whether to use increased precision (default=false)
  - =void SetSeed(uint[])= :: set the stream seeds (note: does not change the package seed)
  - =double[] GetState()= :: returns the current seed
  - =void WriteState()= :: write a brief description to the console
  - =void WriteStateFull()= :: write a full description to the console
 - New methods
  - =void AdvanceState(int e,int c)= :: increment the current seed by \(2^e+c\)
  - =void AdvanceSubstream(int e,int c)= :: increment the substream seed by \(2^e+c\) using substream steps and change the current seed to the same value
  - =void AdvanceStream(int e,int c)= :: increment the current stream by  \(2^e+c\) using stream steps and change the current seed and substream to the same value
